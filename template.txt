Dear %recipient,

I'm excited to be applying for the %position position at %company. With several years of professional software development experience under my belt, I am confident that I will be a great fit as %company's newest %position.
I enjoy being challenged to break down complex problems and solve them, while planning for future additions and changes to the software specs. I also enjoy engaging in projects that require me to work outside my current knowledge base.
At my most recent position at BH Photo Video, I ensured quality of code by reviewing other developers' pull requests. I heightened security by creating an algorithm that determines when a user should reenter credit cards, and by finding and closing security holes in the website (I also won the largest available cash reward for finding a security leak on the site during a company hackathon.)
If you are looking for a developer who is:

*  Highly skilled in designing and developing software
*  %attribute1
*  %attribute2
*  Deeply familiar with data structures and algorithms
*  Well versed with SOLID Design
*  Quick to learn and apply new skills

Then you need look no further. You will see from my attached CV that I meet all these qualifications and more.
I'd be happy to provide names and contact information for references upon request.
To contact me, please call me at 058 713 2013, or email me at judahsch@gmail.com.
Thank you for taking the time to review my resume. I look forward to speaking with you.

Warm regards,
Judah Schwartz
